            <h2>Background</h2><hr>
            <p>Several studies and events have helped to define the scope of critical Internet infrastructure. In August 2013, Internet infrastructure experts including Yuval Shavitt, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Woodcock"> Bill Woodcock</a>, Rossella Mattioli, Thomas Haeberlen, Ethan Katz-Bassett and Roland Dobbins convened for six days at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Dagstuhl">Schloss Dagstuhl</a> to refine the academic and policy understanding of critical Internet infrastructure, producing a number of papers in the process. In 2017, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Commission_on_the_Stability_of_Cyberspace">the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace</a> undertook a global survey of Internet infrastructure experts in order to assess the degree of consensus on what constituted critical Internet infrastructure, producing a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Commission_on_the_Stability_of_Cyberspace#Definition_of_the_Public_Core,_to_which_the_Norm_Applies">Definition of the Public Core</a></i> which has since been used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> and others as a standardized description of the principal elements of Internet critical infrastructure. In addition to these globally-applicable findings, nationally-specific definitions have been made by individual governments, for example by the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office">Government Accountability Office</a> in 2006[4] and the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House">White House</a> in 2013.

        <h2>History of the Web</h2><hr>
        <p>History Of The Web: The <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/world-wide-web-www/">World Wide Web (WWW)</a> is the main way people find information on the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet/">Internet</a>. The Web lets users access a huge amount of content, including the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deep-web-and-dark-web/">deep web, the dark web</a>, and the surface web. This content is connected by hyperlinks, which are electronic links that connect related information, making it easy to find.</p>
        <p>Hypertext allows users to click on words or phrases to find more information. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hypertext-and-hypermedia/">Hypermedia</a> includes links to images, sounds, animations, and movies. The Web works using the Internet's client-server format: servers store and send documents when asked, while clients request these documents.</p>
        <p>Browser software helps users view these documents. Special browsers, like Tor, let users browse anonymously. Hypertext documents are written in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-introduction/">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> and have an online address called a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-url-uniform-resource-locator/">Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>History</h2><hr>
        <p>The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. They made a standard way for computers to communicate, called <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/">HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>. Their text-based Web browser was released in January 1992.</p>
        <p>The Web became popular quickly with the creation of a browser called Mosaic. Developed by Marc Andreessen and his team at the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-springfield">University of Illinois</a>, Mosaic was released in September 1993. It allowed users to click on links and navigate easily. In April 1994, Andreessen co-founded Netscape Communications Corporation and released Netscape Navigator in December 1994, which became the top browser. That same year, BookLink Technologies introduced InternetWorks, the first browser with tabs.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990s, millions of people were using the Web. Microsoft entered the scene with <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-internet-explorer/">Internet Explorer (IE)</a> in 1995, based on Mosaic, and included it in Windows 95. This made IE the most popular browser, reducing competition like <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/companies/netscape-labs">Netscape.</a></p>
        <p>Apple launched Safari in 2003 as the default browser for Macintosh computers, and later for iPhones (2007) and iPads (2010). Safari 2.0 in 2005 introduced Private Browsing, which did not save website history, downloaded files, or personal information.</p>    
        
        <h2>The Web Extends</h2><hr>
        <p>Only a few people had access to the first Web browser, which ran on a NeXT computer. To make it more accessible, Nicola Pellow created a simpler browser called the 'line-mode' browser. This browser could run on any system.</p>
        <p>In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee released his WWW software. It included the 'line-mode' browser, Web server software, and a library for developers. In March 1991, the software was available to CERN colleagues. By August 1991, Berners-Lee announced the WWW software on Internet newsgroups, and interest in the project spread worldwide.</p>

        <h2>The Dot-Com Boom</h2><hr>
        <p>The 1990s saw explosive growth in the popularity of the web, fueled in large part by the dot-com boom. Companies rushed to establish an online presence, leading to the creation of thousands of new websites and the rapid expansion of internet infrastructure.</p>
        <p>During this time, e-commerce emerged as a major force, with companies like Amazon and eBay paving the way for online shopping. The proliferation of search engines like Yahoo! and AltaVista made it easier than ever for users to find information online, further driving the growth of the web.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>
        <p>The history of the Web shows how it has grown from a small project at CERN to a worldwide tool used by millions. Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, it started with basic tools like the 'line-mode' browser and WWW software. The Web became popular with browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, making it easy for people to use. Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari further expanded its reach. The Web has transformed how we access information, proving to be a vital part of our daily lives.</p>

        <h2>Internet use in Lebanon in 2024</h2><hr>
        <p>There were 4.76 million internet users in Lebanon in January 2024.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's internet penetration rate stood at 90.1 percent of the total population at the start of 2024.</p>
        <p>Kepios analysis indicates that internet users in Lebanon decreased by 129 thousand (-2.6 percent) between January 2023 and January 2024.</p>
        <p>For perspective, these user figures reveal that 525.5 thousand people in Lebanon did not use the internet at the start of 2024, suggesting that 9.9 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.</p>
        <p>However, complexities associated with the collection and analysis of internet user data mean that it can often take several months before research is ready for publication. As a result, the latest published figures for internet use invariably under-represent reality, and actual adoption and growth may be higher than the figures shown here suggest. Please see our comprehensive notes on data for further details.</p>

        <h2>Internet connection speeds in Lebanon in 2024</h2><hr>
        <p>Data published by Ookla indicate that internet users in Lebanon could have expected the following internet connection speeds at the start of 2024:</p>
        <p>Median mobile internet connection speed via cellular networks: 31.06 Mbps.</p>
        <p>Median fixed internet connection speed: 9.39 Mbps.</p>
        <p>Ookla's data reveals that the median mobile internet connection speed in Lebanon increased by 2.67 Mbps (+9.4 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2024.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ookla's data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Lebanon increased by 2.14 Mbps (+29.5 percent) during the same period.</p>

        <h2>Social media statistics for Lebanon in 2024</h2><hr>
        <p>DataReportal's figures show that there were 4.52 million active social media user identities in Lebanon in January 2024.</p>
        <p>Note: over the past year, we've made some important changes to how we calculate social media user numbers, and the data sources that we use to inform these calculations have also made significant and wide-ranging revisions to their published figures during that period.</p>
        <p>As a result, our latest figure for social media use might appear to be quite different to the values that we published in previous years.</p>
        <p>Because of this, we advise caution when comparing the social media user values published in this year's reports with those published in previous years, especially because changes in reported values may be the result of "corrections" in the source data, as well as changes in actual user behaviour.</p>
        <p>For clarity, Kepios analysis shows that social media users in Lebanon decreased by 390 thousand (-7.9 percent) between early 2023 and the beginning of 2024.</p>
        <p>The number of social media users in Lebanon at the start of 2024 was equivalent to 85.6 percent of the total population, but it's important to stress that social media users may not represent unique individuals (see our detailed notes on data to learn why).</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 3.92 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Lebanon at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 111 % of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.</p>
        <p>More broadly, 95.0 percent of Lebanon's total internet user base (regardless of age) used at least one social media platform in January 2024.</p>
        <p>At that time, 47.8 percent of Lebanon's social media users were female, while 52.2 percent were male.</p>
